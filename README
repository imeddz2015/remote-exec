A Java library for local or remote execution of commands.

At the moment the following methods for remote execution are supported:
- rsh
- rexec
- SSH2

The library relies on several 3rd party libraries. For rsh and rexec,
Apache Commons Net is required. It is available at:
http://commons.apache.org/net/

For SSH, either Ganymed SSH2 or JSch is required. They are available at
http://www.cleondris.ch/opensource/ssh2/
and
http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/
respectively.

For a brief introduction of the library, see BasicDemo.java. Additionally, 
Javadoc documentation about the API can be generated.
